# GenerateMutationData


#List of research questions

- Can the model represent the location correctly? Basically, the question is if the model can copy the numbers from the src-text
- Is the model able to recognize different surface forms of AA (Can we train a model on long/tripple/or single-forms only?)
  - Long-form (Alanine)
  - Tripple-form (ala)
  - Single-form (A)
- How does our model perform on PubMed? (i.e., use our data from tmVar or SETH)
- Train a model on instances from Pattern 1-100 and test it on unseen patterns
